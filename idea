Our application uses machine learning techniques to foresee rise or drop in
demand for goods before they happen, and inform store and supply chain
owners, so that they can better react to the demands of the future.

We are planning to initially implement the system in the food industry, so
that production can be reduced when demand is going to fall thereby reducing
food wastage and increasing the production to meet demands, before the need
arises.

The system would be scalable, so that it can eventually be implemented in
all facets of commerce.

The system will leverage machine learning and big data so that highly
accurate predictions can be made, and will continuosly learn from previous
mistakes.


The general public, the food industry in the initial phase and eventually
all of the commercial industry, people managing supply chains. In simple
words, all the people who buy things produced by other people /
organizations will benefit from this system.
